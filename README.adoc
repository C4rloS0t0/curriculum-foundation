This repository contains the *curriculum* for version 5 of CPSA-F (which will be mandatory for CPSA-F licensed trainings from September 1^st^ 2019).

This is <<copyrighted,copyrighted work>>.

== What's CPSA-Foundation?
Licensed trainings for _Certified Professional for Software Architecture – Foundation Level (CPSA-F)_ will provide participants with the knowledge and skills required to design, specify and document a software architecture adequate to fulfil the respective requirements for small and medium-sized systems. 

== How to contribute or participate
You found a bug in one of the published versions, have remarks, comments or proposals?

TODO: add issue templates for bugs, comments, proposals

== How to build the documents

Prerequisite: You need a Java Runtime(tm) installed.

You build the output documents with gradle. That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration. 

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
	group 'Documentation'
	description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "renderNoRemarksDE", "renderNoRemarksEN", "renderWithRemarksDE_EN"
}
----

In the "renderNoRemarksDE" certain attributes (aka variables) are defined that configure the corresponding output. 

Please note: You need to include the submodule "pdf-theme" in your checkout, otherwise the build will fail. You can do that with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --recursive --remote
----

== Release process

We have a standardized release process for this document:

=== New major versions of the curriculum
* Announcements: major versions (4.x, 5.x) are announced to training providers at least 3-4 month in advance (usually on the iSAQB members meeting). 
* RC1: About 3 month prior to release, training providers receive the first release candidate (RC1) for review and comments. 
* RC2: 6-8 weeks prior to release they receive the final release candidate RC2, which is _feature frozen_ (meaning neither learning goals nor priorities will substantially change, only bugs and typos will be fixed). 
* Final version (e.g. 5.0) will be made public by iSAQB.org and iSAQB.com
* Released versions will be tagged in git. 

All languages (e.g. DE and EN) will be released at the same time.

=== Updates

In case of typos or other minor changes, we will release updates (e.g. 5.1, 5.2) following a consecutive numbering scheme.

We strive to keep learning content and structure stable across such updates, meaning that no training provider needs to adjust training material in case of minor versions (althouth we cannot ultimately guarantee that).

Therefore updates will just be delivered to training providers.


== Maintainers

image::FLWG-logo.png[width=200,float="left"]
The iSAQB members association regularly elects the *Foundation Level Working Group* (FLWG), consisting of maximum 10 people.
The FLWG is responsible for maintaining the CPSA-F Curriculum. Major version updates are reviewed and discussed with board and the members association prior to publication.


The current (2019) FLWG members are:

* Mahbouba Gharbi
* Dr. Carola Lilienthal
* Dr. Ulrich Becker
* Phillip Ghadir (FLWG co-chair)
* Peter Götz (aka _hero of the build_!)
* Dr. Peter Hruschka
* Dr. Alexander Lorz
* Roger Rhoades
* Mischa Soujon
* Dr. Gernot Starke (FLWG chair)


== What does "Foundation Level" cover?

As stated above, _Foundation Level_ covers small to medium-sized software systems.

Based upon their individual practical experience and existing skills, participants will learn to derive architectural decisions from an existing system vision and adequately detailed requirements. 
CPSA-F trainings teach methods and principles for design, communication, documentation and evaluation of software architectures, independent of specific development processes.

Focus is education and training of the following skills:

* Discuss and reconcile fundamental architectural decisions with stakeholders from requirements, management, development, operations and test,
* understand the essential activities of software architecture, and carry out those for small- to medium sized systems,
* document and communicate software architectures based upon architectural views, architecture patterns and technical concepts

In addition, such trainings cover

* the tasks and responsibilities of software architect
* the term software architecture and its meaning
* the roles of software architects within development
* state-of-the-art methods and techniques for developing software architectures
