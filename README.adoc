This repository contains the *curriculum* for the upcoming version 5 of CPSA-F (which is scheduled for productive use not before July 2019).

== What's CPSA-Foundation?
Licensed trainings for _Certified Professional for Software Architecture – Foundation Level (CPSA-F)_ will provide participants with the knowledge and skills required to design, specify and document a software architecture adequate to fulfil the respective requirements for small and medium-sized systems. 

== How to contribute or participate
You found a bug in one of the published versions, have remarks, comments or proposals?

TODO: add issue templates for bugs, comments, proposals

== How to build the documents

Prerequisite: You need a Java Runtime(tm) installed.

You build the output documents with gradle. That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration. 

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
	group 'Documentation'
	description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "renderNoRemarksDE", "renderNoRemarksEN", "renderWithRemarksDE_EN"
}
----

In the "renderNoRemarksDE" certain attributes (aka variables) are defined that configure the corresponding output. 

Please note: You need to include the submodule "pdf-theme" in your checkout, otherwise the build will fail. You can do that with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --recursive --remote
----

=== Legacy build

There is a Docker-based build available in https://github.com/isaqb-org/adoc2pdf[its own repository], in case you cannot build with gradle. 


== Maintainers

image::FLWG-logo.png[width=200,float="left"]
The iSAQB members association regularly elects the *Foundation Level Working Group* (FLWG), consisting of maximum 10 people.
The FLWG is responsible for maintaining the CPSA-F Curriculum. Major version updates are reviewed and discussed with board and the members association prior to publication.


The current (2019) FLWG members are:

* Mahbouba Gharbi
* Dr. Carola Lilienthal
* Dr. Ulrich Becker
* Phillip Ghadir (FLWG co-chair)
* Peter Götz (aka _hero of the build_!)
* Dr. Peter Hruschka
* Dr. Alexander Lorz
* Roger Rhoades
* Mischa Soujon
* Dr. Gernot Starke (FLWG chair)



== What does "Foundation Level" cover?

As stated above, _Foundation Level_ covers small to medium-sized software systems.

Based upon their individual practical experience and existing skills, participants will learn to derive architectural decisions from an existing system vision and adequately detailed requirements. 
CPSA-F trainings teach methods and principles for design, communication, documentation and evaluation of software architectures, independent of specific development processes.

Focus is education and training of the following skills:

* Discuss and reconcile fundamental architectural decisions with stakeholders from requirements, management, development, operations and test,
* understand the essential activities of software architecture, and carry out those for small- to medium sized systems,
* document and communicate software architectures based upon architectural views, architecture patterns and technical concepts

In addition, such trainings cover

* the tasks and responsibilities of software architect
* the term software architecture and its meaning
* the roles of software architects within development
* state-of-the-art methods and techniques for developing software architectures


== Contributors
