The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects. You can find download links in the following sections.

The **Foundation Level** curriculum is currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE). Maintainers from the Foundation-Level-Working-Group and voluntary reviewers collaborate on https://github.com/isaqb-org[Github] to improve the curriculum.
