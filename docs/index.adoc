The current productive version (aka: relevant for examinations) is version 4.1 (EN) and 4.2 (DE), both of which are currently only available via the official https://isaqb.org[iSAQB website].

The Foundation Level curriculum is currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE). Maintainers from the Foundation-Level-Working-Group and voluntary reviewers collaborate on Github to improve the curriculum.
