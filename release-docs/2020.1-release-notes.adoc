=== Substantial changes:
• LG 2-5 removed “Self-contained systems” from microservice pattern, as these two are not the same thing, #204
• LG 2-6 fixed translation of “expect errors”, #202
• LG 2-6 rephrased “conceptual integrity”, #202
• LG 2-7 added “messaging/events” to list of coupling types, #201


== Changelog for RC2 Oct 19^th^, 2020 (curated)
=== Substantial Changes:
* LG 2-6 fixed several wrong relevance-levels on sub-learning-goal headings
* LG 2-7 renamed LG to “managing dependencies” (instead of “planning dependencies”, #195)
* LG 3-6 demoted “documenting cross-cutting concepts” to R2 (#186)
* LG 3-8 promoted “documenting architecture-decisions” to R1, added ADR (#187)

=== Trivial Changes:
* LG 1-2 unified wording, to “goals and benefits” (#192)
* LG 1-5 more consistent wording (#196)
* added some references to section 1 (Fundamentals)
* LG 2-1 fixed typo

== Changelog for RC1 Oct 6^th^, 2020 (curated)
* Prerequisites have been clarified, "object-oriented language" has been replaced by "higher-level language"
* LG 1-2 received additional sub-goals and explanation
* LG 1-11 has been added (R3), naming some characteristics and challenges of distributed systems
* LG 2-1 mentions additional architecture "methods" (Evolutionary Architecture, Global-Analysis), all R3.
Better indication which method has which exam relevance
* LG 2-3 major overhaul: new structure of LG, new and explicit collection of influencing factors
* LG 2-5 completely restructured list of patterns. A few R1, many optional R3. R1 now covers Microservices and Dependency Injection (yes, after lengthy discussions we decided to add it as a fundamental pattern here. Please note: The list of optional R3 patterns give trainers the opportunity to add specific content as needed.
* LG 2-6 completely restructured ist of design principles. As we consider this topic to be one of the most important in architecture education, we collected all the fundamental principles in a modular structure. Trainers most likely will have to adapt training material to this new and enhanced LG.
* LG 3-2 improved wording, explained the need for specific adaption of documentation
* LG 3-3 demoted a few diagram types to R3, ArchiMate has been added to the list
* LG 3-10 RM/ODP has been removed, some references added
* Additional references have been added, some references updated to newer editions or versions
* Inconsistencies in translation between EN and DE have been sorted out
* Numerous typos and hyperlinks have been fixed

* Styling of PDF documents has been improved
* Improved the build and release toolchain

== Known Issues
* In all sections "Important terms" at the beginning of each curriculum section, numerous terms are missing the hyperlinks into the iSAQB glossary.
* On macOS, the hyperlinks to the iSAQB glossary within PDF documents fail in the standard "Preview" app. Firefox and AcrobatReader work fine. See https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-foundation/issues/189
